        This amazing apple pie recipe belonged to my grandmother. I have never seen another one quite like it! It will always be my 
        favorite and has won several first place prizes in local competitions. It makes the perfect dessert for family dinners or during 
        the holidays, topped with whipped cream or ice cream, or alongside a slice of Cheddar cheese.

            <strong>Assemble the pie</strong>: Press one crust into a pie plate. Place the sliced apples on the bottom crust. Use the top crust to make a lattice crust according to the recipe below. Pour the butter-sugar mixture over the lattice crust.
